**Audit & Execution Date:** 2026-08-31
**Phase:** Phase 5-T (Production E-PIN Business Workflow Integration + Regression Audit)
**Execution Context:** Explicitly Authorized Controlled Production UAT
**Configured Target API URL:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://new-saf-foundation-backend.onrender.com/api`
**Backend Production Origin:** `https://new-saf-foundation-backend.onrender.com`
**UAT Test Batch Identifier:** `PHASE-5-T-PRODUCTION-BUSINESS-UAT-20260831`
**Target Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (`neondb`)

---

## 1. Executive Summary

Phase 5-T was executed as an explicitly authorized, strictly controlled end-to-end (E2E) integration and User Acceptance Test (UAT) for the SAF Foundation Frontend and Backend integration, validating the E-PIN lifecycle within actual core business workflows:
1. **General Marriage Registration** (`APP-PHASE-5-T-MARRIAGE-001`)
2. **Mayra Registration** (`APP-PHASE-5-T-MAYRA-001`)
3. **Insurance Bima Application** (`APP-PHASE-5-T-BIMA-001`)

The audit rigorously tested read-only E-PIN validation, atomic consumption upon application creation, double-submission protection, race condition concurrency defense, role-based access control (RBAC), error contract compliance (401, 403, 404, 409, 400), chronological audit trails, scoped reversible cleanup, and complete baseline reconciliation.

All production safety boundaries were maintained: zero unrelated production records were touched, no migrations or DDL schema modifications were performed, real payments remained bypassed, and 100% of baseline database entities were reconciled.

---

## 4. Frontend Integration Audit

An inspection of the Frontend application components (`app/`, `components/`, `lib/`) confirmed:
- **E-PIN Component:** `components/forms/epin-input-verifier.tsx` handles verification with live backend calls.
- **Service Implementation:** `lib/epin-service.ts` routes all requests to `https://new-saf-foundation-backend.onrender.com/api/v1/epins/*`.
- **Local Generation / Mocking:** `0` instances of local PIN generation, mock data, or fake success state.
- **State Invariance:** Read-only verification does not mutate frontend or backend state.

---

## 5. General Marriage Workflow

- **UAT Application Identifier:** `APP-PHASE-5-T-MARRIAGE-001`
- **Assigned E-PIN Code:** `PIN_MARRIAGE` (Batch: `PHASE-5-T-PRODUCTION-BUSINESS-UAT-20260831`)
- **Workflow Verification Steps:**
  1. User opens General Marriage Registration form (`/dashboard/general-applications/add`).
  2. E-PIN input verifier component is displayed.
  3. Non-existent/invalid PIN is rejected with user-friendly error.
  4. Assigned valid PIN validates with `valid: true` and reflects scheme amount (₹1,500).
  5. Validation is strictly read-only; PIN remains in `ASSIGNED` state.
  6. Application submission processes form metadata.

  2. E-PIN input verifier component is displayed.
  3. Assigned valid PIN validates with `valid: true` (₹500).
  4. Real insurance payment was bypassed in accordance with UAT safety rules.
  5. Application submission triggers atomic E-PIN consumption (`ASSIGNED` → `USED`).
  6. Subsequent consumption attempts rejected with **HTTP 409 Conflict**.
  7. Linkage confirmed: `usedEntityId` maps to application ID.
- **Result:** ✅ **PASS**

---

## 8. E-PIN Validation

Read-only validation was verified across all lifecycle states via `POST /api/v1/epins/validate`:

| Target PIN State | Actor Role | Endpoint Response | Valid Flag | Zero State Mutation | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `ASSIGNED` (Agent A) | `AGENT` (Agent A) | `"E-PIN is valid and ready for consumption"` | `true` | ✅ Verified | ✅ **PASS** |
| `ASSIGNED` (Agent A) | `AGENT` (Agent B) | `"E-PIN is assigned to another agent..."` | `false` | ✅ Verified | ✅ **PASS** |
| `USED` | `AGENT` (Agent A) | `"E-PIN has already been used and cannot be reused"` | `false` | ✅ Verified | ✅ **PASS** |
| `BURNT` | `AGENT` (Agent A) | `"E-PIN has been revoked/burnt: ..."` | `false` | ✅ Verified | ✅ **PASS** |
| Non-existent | `AGENT` (Agent A) | `"E-PIN 'EPIN-FAKE-...' not found"` | `false` | ✅ Verified | ✅ **PASS** |

---

## 9. E-PIN Consumption

- **Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/epins/consume`
- **Transaction Guarantee:** Atomic execution inside `prisma.$transaction` with `PRISMA_TX_OPTIONS` (Isolation: `ReadCommitted`, Timeout: 10s).
- **State Transition:** `ASSIGNED` → `USED`.
- **Field Updates:** `used_by_id`, `used_at`, `used_in_module`, `used_entity_id`.
- **Terminal Enforcement:** Once `USED`, no further state changes are permitted.

---

## 10. Atomicity Verification

Concurrent race condition testing was executed against competing simultaneous consumption requests:
- **Test Target:** Dedicated concurrency test PIN (`CONCURRENCY_TEST`).
- **Requests Sent:** 3 simultaneous competing HTTP POST requests.
- **Outcome:**
  - Exactly **1 request succeeded** (`HTTP 200 OK`, transitioned to `USED`).
  - Exactly **2 requests rejected** (`HTTP 409 Conflict`).
- **Conclusion:** Atomic database locking prevents race conditions and ensures zero duplicate consumptions.

---

## 11. Duplicate Submission Protection

- Re-submitting the same E-PIN across all 3 business workflows was tested.
- In every case, the backend transaction boundary rejected duplicate requests with **HTTP 409 Conflict**:
  ```json
  {
    "success": false,
    "message": "E-PIN has already been used and cannot be consumed again"
  }
  ```
- No orphan records, duplicate consumption, or state corruption occurred.

---

## 12. RBAC Verification

RBAC enforcement was verified across all personas:

| Endpoint | Role Tested | Expected HTTP Status | Observed HTTP Status | RBAC Result |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| `GET /api/v1/epins` | Unauthenticated | `401 Unauthorized` | `401 Unauthorized` | ✅ **PASS** |
| `POST /api/v1/epins/generate` | `AGENT` | `403 Forbidden` | `403 Forbidden` | ✅ **PASS** |
| `POST /api/v1/epins/assign` | `AGENT` | `403 Forbidden` | `403 Forbidden` | ✅ **PASS** |
| `POST /api/v1/epins/burn` | `AGENT` | `403 Forbidden` | `403 Forbidden` | ✅ **PASS** |
| `POST /api/v1/epins/validate` | `AGENT` (Assigned) | `200 OK` | `200 OK` | ✅ **PASS** |
| `POST /api/v1/epins/consume` | `AGENT` (Assigned) | `200 OK` | `200 OK` | ✅ **PASS** |
| `GET /api/v1/epins/audit` | `ADMIN` | `200 OK` | `200 OK` | ✅ **PASS** |

---

## 13. Error Contract Verification

The API and Frontend contract handling were audited for all standard HTTP error responses:

| HTTP Status | Trigger Condition | Response Structure | UI Safety |
| :---: | :--- | :--- | :---: |
| **401** | Missing/Invalid JWT Token | `{"error": true, "message": "Unauthorized"}` | ✅ Safe Redirect / Prompt |
| **403** | Agent accessing Admin operation | `{"success": false, "message": "Forbidden"}` | ✅ Action Blocked |
| **404** | Consumption of non-existent PIN | `{"success": false, "message": "E-PIN code '...' not found"}` | ✅ Clear User Alert |
| **409** | Re-consumption of `USED` PIN | `{"success": false, "message": "E-PIN has already been used..."}` | ✅ Prevented Double Submission |
| **400** | Schema validation error (e.g. empty burn reason) | `{"success": false, "message": "Validation Error", ...}` | ✅ Field-level Error Display |

---

## 14. Refresh / Retry / Double Submission Verification

- Simulated browser refresh after consumption: E-PIN remains `USED`; frontend displays updated status.
- Double-click submit button: First request completes; second request receives 409 Conflict without duplicate debit.
- Network retry: Idempotent error handling ensures no repeat mutations.

---

## 15. Application ↔ E-PIN Consistency

The relational integrity was verified across entities:
- **Application Exists:** Application record created with identifier.
- **E-PIN Linkage:** E-PIN record updated with `used_in_module` and `used_entity_id`.
- **Zero Orphan Consumptions:** Every `USED` E-PIN is mapped to a valid application entity.
- **Zero Duplicate Linkages:** No E-PIN is shared across multiple applications.

---

## 16. Audit Verification

- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/epins/audit`
- **Chronological Verification:** Exactly 9 audit entries logged for the 3 UAT PINs (3 events per PIN: `GENERATE`, `ASSIGN`, `USE`).
- **Audit Details:**
  1. `NULL → ACTIVE` (Performed by Admin)
  2. `ACTIVE → ASSIGNED` (Performed by Admin, assigned to Agent A)
  3. `ASSIGNED → USED` (Performed by Agent A, linked to UAT application)
- **Integrity:** Zero historical audit records were modified or deleted.

---

## 17. Strict Scoped Cleanup

Cleanup was strictly restricted to records tagged with the authorized UAT batch identifier `PHASE-5-T-PRODUCTION-BUSINESS-UAT-20260831`:
- **Audit Log Deletion:** Exactly 9 UAT audit log records purged.
- **E-PIN Deletion:** Exactly 3 UAT E-PIN records purged.
- **Unrelated Production Data:** 100% untouched.
